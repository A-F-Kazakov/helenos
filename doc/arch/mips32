SPARTAN kernel currently supports emulated MIPS R4000 32-bit
little-endian architecture. In other words, it can only run in MIPS
R4000 emulator called msim. This emulator is being developed by Viliam
Holub:

Note that msim diverges from real MIPS hardware in some aspects.
Therefore, some non-trivial changes will be necessary for a real
hardware port. The simulator is described in this manual:
